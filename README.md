## Project title
Marconnect

## Team Members

* Brian Zou (bz2193)
* Andrew Bao (ab10171)
* Marcus Chau (mc8786)


## What and why?
* Current meeting software for collaboration are not catered towards the needs of engineers
* User experience is fragmented, requiring users to juggle different platforms (requiring context switches) rather than having a unified platform with the various functionalities
* For example, as a CS student who wants to get help from a tutor on my assignment, I have to share my screen and switch in and out of zoom and my IDE. My tutor is also not able to directly interact with my code and must verbally tell me what lines to change.
* Marconnect is a video conferencing platform that would integrate all of these features into one place, where we can conduct video call while collaborating and writing code in one shared platform. Imagine zoom + vscode + google docs.


## For whom?
* Developers looking to collaborate (e.g. pair programming, full time engineers)
* Tutors, Teaching Assistants, Educators, and Computer Science students looking to troubleshoot some code or for other forms of collaboration (e.g. office hours)
* Companies looking to perform live coding interviews over a meeting platform (enables interviewer and interviewee to see the code live on the same platform)

## How?
We propose Marconnect to have the following features:
* Room creation / joining capabilities
* Video and audio conference (one-on-one)
* Messaging feature (chatbox)
* Collaborative whiteboard functionality with multiple windows
* Collaborative code editor on demand (with code compilation as a stretch goal)
* Generative AI chatbot (as a stretch goal)
* Notetaking functionality (as a stretch goal)
* Security and log-in features (as a stretch goal)
* Group video and audio conference (as a stretch goal)

## Scope
This project is on the more ambitious side, however it is feasible with a group of 4-5 developers. Some features in the project involve working with the latest technologies such as Kubernetes and WebRTC which can have a slightly challenging learning curve.
However, it is doable because some components (such as video connection and whiteboard functionality) may have open source libraries that we can easily integrate into our application.  The design is also very modularized. Thus, if we run into unforeseen issues, they will not have a major impact on our core features that we would like to deliver.
